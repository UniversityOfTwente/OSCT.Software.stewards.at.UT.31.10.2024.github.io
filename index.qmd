# Context: Definition of software

Definition of research software from the FAIR for Research Software Working Group

```
“Includes source code files, algorithms, scripts, computational workflows 
and executables that were created during the research process or for 
a research purpose.”]
```
[Defining Research Software: a controversial discussion](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5504015)

# Context: Software as a valuable resource


```
“Software plays an increasingly important role in research 
and it has become a key output of many research projects.”
```

```
“Making research software openly and sustainably available 
supports reproducibility and reusability of research outcomes 
and contributes to further research – key elements in the 
transition to open science.”
```
